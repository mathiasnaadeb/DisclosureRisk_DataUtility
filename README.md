# DisclosureRisk_DataUtility
This is to evaluate the disclosure risk and data utility of partially synthetic data.
We desire to have data with very low disclosure risk but also, a high data utility. This is often difficult to achieve.
This project looks at the possibility of using partially synthetic data as way of mininimizing disclosure risk whilst maximizing data utility through a simulation.
The disclosure risk and data utility of the partially synthetic data is evaluated by comparing it to local suppression which is a common approach for data anonymization
